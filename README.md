# twilt
Twilt is a Vue.js component library based on Tailwind.css
This is a pet project by Skaman Sam Tyler to learn Vite, Tailwind, Vue 3, and npm packaging, but I hope you get something out of it as well.

# Vue 3 + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.
